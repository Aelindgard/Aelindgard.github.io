# Course Overview
This course aims to impart the fundamental knowledge required for Software Development that is common across the different programming language.

This course **will not cover any specific programming language** but will employ the use of the **International Baccalaureate’s Pseudo Code notation**. The IB Pseudo Code notation was chosen as it is well defined examinable notation which contains the common elements found in the major programming language in use.

## Target Audience
This course is designed with the following audience in mind:
* Those who wish to have a general understanding of software development
* Those looking to prepare for GCSE O/A Computer Science
* Those looking to prepare for IB Computer Science
* Those looking to prepare for NITEC/Higher NITEC in Technology
* Those looking to prepare for IT related Diplomas

## Required Resources
Computer with internet connection and the following software:
* Visual Studio Code with the following plugin:
* IBCS Pseudocode
* Microsoft Teams

## Course Materials
Course materials will be provided via an online repository.
